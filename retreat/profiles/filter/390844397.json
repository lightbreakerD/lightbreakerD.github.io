When not studying I am an independent data scientist with a focus on health data and public health administration analytics.","summary":"With ten years’ experience with health data and statistical programming and data juggling in the public sector administration in Denmark, I began a new chapter in my work life as independent computer programmer in spring 2016. My main interest lies in technical solution for complex problems. In my work with health data, I have used the SAS-platform and development environment for anything ranging from simple statistical analysis to more advanced process automation and dynamically structed coding. Apart from that, I also enjoy coding in Python and can find my way around C/C++, Excel/VBA and R. I have a background in both mathematics and anthropology. This combination allows me to both understand abstract problems and translate them into concrete solutions, bridging the gap between the technical sphere and the human realm. 12 years experience as teaching assistant at the University of Copenhagen and the IT-University has taught me how to communicate complex theoretical material to new learners. I have a few steady customers, but If you need my help, I will probably have spare time for expanding my customer portfolio a bit. My technical experience can be summed up in the following: I am expert in: - Python (pytorch, numpy, scikit-learn, pandas etc) - SAS programming (base, macro, sql, dynamic coding, data wrangling etc.) - Data analytics - Machine Learning and Deep Learning Things that I'm also pretty good at: - Health Data (Danish National Patients Registry (LPR), all other Danish national patient registries such as the cancer registry, the birth registry etc.) - Algorithms and mathematical modelling - Project management - Statistical analysis Stuff that I know at an intermediate level - C/C++ - MS powershell - Linux - Excel/VBA Stuff that I know just well enough to allow me to cause a major fuckup: - coming soon!","picture_url":"https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/9c8pery4andzj6ohjkjp54ma2","location_country":"Denmark","location_country_iso2":"DK","location_country_iso3":"DNK","location_full":"Copenhagen, Capital Region of Denmark, Denmark","location_regions":["Europe","Northern Europe","EMEA","EU"],"location_city":"Copenhagen","location_state":"Capital Region of Denmark","interests":[],"inferred_skills":["health","programming","administration","spring","sas","analysis","automation","python","c","vba","r","mathematics","anthropology","concrete","teaching","numpy","sql","analytics","danish","cancer","algorithms","management","powershell","linux","statistics","organized","finance","production","planning","communications","collaboration","research","projects","supervision","assurance","philosophy","science","lecturing","spss","workshops","algebra","biology","microeconomics","drawing","legal","governance","accountability","maintenance","statistical programming","public sector","process automation","sas programming","data analytics","machine learning","deep learning","project management","international relations","international organizations","health economics","quality assurance","assistant teaching","mathematical analysis","linear algebra","public administration","public health","press releases"],"historical_skills":["scientific writing","economics","international relations","editing","mathematics","politics","intercultural communication","analysis","danish","academic writing","theory","social sciences","sas programming","lecturing","epidemiology","science","latex","mathematical modeling","statistics","linux","research","english","spanish","r","public health","ballade","program evaluation","writing","spss","survey design","marx","data analysis","teaching","quantitative analysis","python","sas/sql","field work","anthropology","participant observation","university teaching","quantitative research","research design","ethnography","sas","qualitative research"],"connections_count":500,"followers_count":818,"services":null,"primary_professional_email":null,"primary_professional_email_status":null,"professional_emails_collection":[],"is_working":null,"active_experience_company_id":null,"active_experience_title":null,"active_experience_description":null,"active_experience_department":null,"active_experience_management_level":null,"is_decision_maker":null,"total_experience_duration_months":241,"total_experience_duration_months_breakdown_department":[{"department":"Other","total_experience_duration_months":6},{"department":"Education","total_experience_duration_months":107},{"department":"Administrative","total_experience_duration_months":27},{"department":"Consulting","total_experience_duration_months":106}],"total_experience_duration_months_breakdown_management_level":[{"management_level":"Intern","total_experience_duration_months":21},{"management_level":"Specialist","total_experience_duration_months":210},{"management_level":"Head","total_experience_duration_months":27}],"experience":[{"active_experience":0,"position_title":"Consultant","department":"Consulting","management_level":"Specialist","location":"Copenhagen","description":"With ten years’ experience with health data from public administration in Denmark, I chose to start as independent data analyst in 2016.
