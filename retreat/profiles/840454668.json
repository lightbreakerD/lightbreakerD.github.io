Optimise the process of new client intake at medical hospitals and clinics. Basically, making the process of new client arriving to understanding the patient and his medical history more efficient. How did we do this?\n\nWe built 2 solutions. One for the patient, another for the doctor. Our patient onboarding had easy and accessible steps for uploading the user’s medical data. The patient could then have a 𝗻𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝘃𝗼𝗶𝗰𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 with an AI Agent regarding his pain and automatically book an appointment. \n\nFor doctors, we built an intuitive UI, where he could easily view his patients.

For years, we were told that code would eat the world. And yet, walking through Munich (or Garching if you want the symbolism) today, it feels like the world is starting to eat code back.\n\nTwo years ago, when we led a €20M seed round in a company called Proxima Fusion it, nominally, seemed to be an investment into fusion. But to call it that would be like describing the moon landing as a good use of kerosene. \n\nIt was, more precisely, a belief that Europe hadn’t forgotten to build what matters. Not in apps. Not in abstractions. But in people who still bend metal, build machines, and dare to alter physics. \n\nAt the time, it felt almost contrarian to believe that this continent, with its long winters and cautious investors, could still produce the kind of ambition that once powered its industrial age. But now, that belief is starting to look less naïve.\n\nMunich is in the proof. TUM, LMU, and Max Planck students are quietly dropping out of academia to found companies instead of publishing papers. Siemens, BMW, and Airbus supply the industrial gravity. Something is shifting here and it feels less like Berlin in 2018 and more like Palo Alto in 1968. \n\nThis is what happens when engineers start dreaming again.\n\nYou see it everywhere:\n- Proxima Fusion - building machines that could give humanity infinite clean energy.\n- Helsing - creating AI that defends democracies.\n- The Exploration Company - bringing back the spirit of European spaceflight.\n- Isar Aerospace - building rockets to enable access.\n- Quantum Systems - fusing hardware, autonomy, and defense.\n- Hades Mining , Alpine Eagle , Manex AI , microagi , OSM , CedarDB , Neoways , CoBrowser - each proof that Europe is rediscovering its taste for hard problems.\n\n... and they don’t behave like European startups. They behave like global companies that happen to be European.\n\nAt redalpine , we’ve been betting on this intersection - software meeting science - for nearly two decades. When we started, there wasn’t even a word for it. Now it’s called “DeepTech,” though what’s really happening is that the boundary between science and entrepreneurship is dissolving. \n\nAnd that, I think, is the quiet truth beneath all this noise about Europe “catching up.” Europe doesn’t need to become Silicon Valley. It just needs to remember what it once was. \n\nIf a next generation of global companies is born here, it will likely be in places like Munich and Zurich, built on a culture that still believes in precision, iteration, and patience - things Silicon Valley forgot when it traded atoms for ads.\n\nIf you’re building at that intersection - let’s talk. 🤘","action":"Jonas Jacob Biermann liked this","order_in_profile":14},{"activity_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/robertwille_students-lectures-winterterm-activity-7382422967122812928-Xns1","title":"🎓 Welcome, #students of Technische Universität München !👋\n \nNext week marks the official start of #lectures for the #WinterTerm — and the start of numerous students into their first semester!\n\nToday, I had the pleasure of #welcoming some of you with a brief mini lecture on “Highlights of Computer Science” — a small teaser of what’s to come.\n\n🙏 A big thank you to the Fachschaft Mathematik/Physik/Informatik/Chemie ( #MPIC ) for organizing this as part of the Studieneinführungstage — the orientation days for new students at #TUM .\n\nWishing everyone a fantastic start into the #semester .

I can now proudly say: Mówię trochę po polsku (I speak a little Polish).\n\n🔸 Politics & History\nOne of the highlights was the lecture series by Dr. Piotr Horbatowski on the Round Table talks, the Solidarność movement, and the transition from communism to democracy. We also went on numerous excursions: to Nowa Huta, a district created under the Six-Year Plan of the communists, visits to old factories, shelters, and conversations with the Solidarity trade union.\n\n🔸 Kraków – a City of Many Facets\nKraków revealed itself to us from different angles: from the historic old town with its churches, castles, and art, to the Jewish quarter, the former ghetto, and Schindler’s Factory. Each tour opened up new perspectives.\n\n🔸 Auschwitz – an Experience That Leaves a Mark\nWhat moved me most deeply was the visit to Auschwitz. Despite all I had already learned through books, documentaries, workshops, and my own engagement against antisemitism, I could not hold back my tears. Standing in those rooms, seeing those images, makes you grasp the sheer magnitude of horror in a way nothing else can. It leaves you with a deep sense of responsibility: to make sure that such suffering never happens again.\n\nThis study academy was far more than just an exchange program. It was an intense learning journey that enriched me with new language skills, deeper historical understanding, and invaluable encounters.\n\n🙏🏻 A heartfelt thank you to the Hans Böckler Foundation for making this unforgettable experience possible.","action":"Jonas Jacob Biermann liked this","order_in_profile":18},{"activity_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/wunderfund-llc_if-your-idea-of-a-good-time-includes-tweaking-activity-7375892378689249280-kzMJ","title":"If your idea of a good time includes tweaking R² at 3 a.m., this is for you. 🤓 \nWe launched the Wunder RNN Challenge for those who train neural networks at work, after work, and sometimes instead of work (+weekends). \n\nYou’re invited to create a model that predicts the next market state from a sequence of previous states.\n\n→ Timeline: September 15 — December 1\n→ Prize pool: $13,600 USDT\n\nThis is the kind of challenge quants face every day.
