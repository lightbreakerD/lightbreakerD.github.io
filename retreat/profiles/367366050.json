Despite this, it has thus far delivered little value to the speech science community, as the new methods do not meet the controllability demands that practitioners in this area require. Many disciplines, e.g., phonetics, rely on listening tests with manipulated speech stimuli. These are created using legacy signal-processing methods for controlling different speech properties of interest, which limits the range, accuracy, and speech quality of possible manipulations. Audible artefacts caused by these methods also have a negative impact on the methodological validity of research on natural speech perception. This work introduces a system capable of modifying phonetically relevant speech properties through learning rather than design. The architecture learns to control arbitrary speech properties and leverages progress in neural vocoders to obtain highly realistic output. Experiments with copy synthesis and with manipulation of a small set of core speech features (pitch, formants, and voice quality measures) illustrate the promise of the approach for producing speech stimuli that are both accurately controllable and have high perceptual quality.

In this paper, we analyze the position embeddings of existing language models, finding strong evidence of translation invariance, both for the embeddings themselves and for their effect on self-attention. The degree of translation invariance increases during training and correlates positively with model performance. Our findings lead us to propose translation-invariant self-attention (TISA), which accounts for the relative position between tokens in an interpretable fashion without needing conventional position embeddings. Our proposal has several theoretical advantages over existing position-representation approaches. Experiments show that it improves on regular ALBERT on GLUE tasks, while only adding orders of magnitude less positional parameters.

Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results across all tasks, on four datasets from a variety of domains. We perform experiments comparing different techniques to construct span representations. Contextualized embeddings like BERT perform well at capturing relationships among entities in the same or adjacent sentences, while dynamic span graph updates model long-range cross-sentence relationships. For instance, propagating span representations via predicted coreference links can enable the model to disambiguate challenging entity mentions.

This approach was tested during the second instalment of the Amazon Alexa Prize 2018 (AP2018), both for the data collection and to feed a simple dialog system which would use the graph to provide answers. As users interacted with the system, a graph which maintained the structure of the dialogs was built, identifying parts where more coverage was needed. In an offline evaluation, we have compared the corpus collected during the competition with other potential corpora for training chatbots, including movie subtitles, online chat forums and conversational data. The results show that the proposed methodology creates data that is more representative of actual user utterances, and leads to more coherent and engaging answers from the agent. An implementation of the proposed method is available as open-source code.

The system uses a dialog graph for retrieving an approximation of the current dialog context in order to find suitable response candidates in this context. The graph is gradually built using user utterances from actual interactions, and system responses suggested by crowd workers. To this end, we developed an automatic system for finding dialog contexts that were often visited but lacked system responses in order to automatically post tasks on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Workers could see a brief excerpt of past conversation history and were asked to suggest a good response, based on a description of the system’s persona and a set of rules that would help foster more engaging conversations. Our main contributions are 1) describing the use of a graph-based approach for context modeling, 2) techniques used in order to make the crowd workers author good content, and 3) discussion of learning outcomes from the Alexa Prize challenge.
