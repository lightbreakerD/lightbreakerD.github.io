Computer Systems and Networks | Software Engineering Intern at Ericsson R&D","summary":"Former machine operator at AstraZeneca, where a substantial part was spent as a technician within the maintenance division. The employment was in collaboration with Mälardalens Tekniska Gymnasium (MTG), where I studied the technology program with an orientation towards Industrial production with a specialization in Design and production development. Through multiple internships at Scania and AstraZeneca, I have had the possibility to work as a trainee and apply the theoretical knowledge from MTG onto the industries. In the future, I have plans on continuing my studies at a Swedish technical institute towards a degree in Master of Science in Engineering, within the area of computer science and engineering. My future vision is to be a part of research and development within a company, or as a self-employed founder. The areas in which I am interested, are mainly robotics, applied physics & mechanics, programming, and machine learning, but I am always open to new interests and experiences. In my spare time, I usually spend it with friends and family, but also enjoy weightlifting, as a part of personal development, traveling and photography. I previously practiced springboard diving for twelve years, and worked as a diving coach instructor at SSIF and SPIF, during my studies at Mälardalens Tekniska Gymnasium. Springboard diving was something I enjoyed, and the coaching developed my leadership. At the moment, I am looking forward to expanding my range of interests and try new hobbies.","picture_url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C5603AQHJDTWdSWpBnQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0/1624560381218?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=yZLBgCE65dmc0HXDoxYw2xrlY7vxFbAMH-uERFw3_FQ","location_country":"Sweden","location_country_iso2":"SE","location_country_iso3":"SWE","location_full":"Gothenburg, Västra Götaland County, Sweden","location_regions":["Europe","Northern Europe","EMEA","EU"],"location_city":"Gothenburg","location_state":"Västra Götaland County","interests":[],"inferred_skills":["maintenance","collaboration","technology","production","design","swedish","science","engineering","research","robotics","physics","mechanics","programming","photography","diving","coaching","leadership","software","r","computer science","machine learning","personal development"],"historical_skills":[],"connections_count":381,"followers_count":380,"services":null,"primary_professional_email":null,"primary_professional_email_status":null,"professional_emails_collection":[],"is_working":1,"active_experience_company_id":6264961,"active_experience_title":"Software Developer R D","active_experience_description":null,"active_experience_department":"Engineering and Technical","active_experience_management_level":"Specialist","is_decision_maker":0,"total_experience_duration_months":67,"total_experience_duration_months_breakdown_department":[{"department":"Human Resources","total_experience_duration_months":11},{"department":"Education","total_experience_duration_months":50},{"department":"Other","total_experience_duration_months":14},{"department":"Engineering and Technical","total_experience_duration_months":17},{"department":"Trades","total_experience_duration_months":5}],"total_experience_duration_months_breakdown_management_level":[{"management_level":"Specialist","total_experience_duration_months":67},{"management_level":"Intern","total_experience_duration_months":14}],"experience":[{"active_experience":1,"position_title":"Software Developer R D","department":"Engineering and Technical","management_level":"Specialist","location":"Göteborg, Västra Götalands län, Sverige","description":null,"date_from":"August 2024","date_from_year":2024,"date_from_month":8,"date_to":null,"date_to_year":null,"date_to_month":null,"duration_months":15,"company_id":6264961,"company_name":"Ericsson","company_type":"Public Company","company_founded_year":1876,"company_followers_count":2217527,"company_website":"https://www.ericsson.com","company_facebook_url":["https://www.facebook.com/ericsson"],"company_twitter_url":["https://www.twitter.com/ericsson"],"company_linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/ericsson","company_size_range":"10,001+ employees","company_employees_count":97353,"company_industry":"Telecommunications","company_categories_and_keywords":["telecommunications","5g","internet of things","mobile broadband","communication services","managed services","fixed broadband","lte","3g","4g","oss","bss","cloud","network","telecom","ict","it","ip","technology for good","sustainability","iot","intelligent transport systems","ai","r&d","communication","mission critical communications","network automation","sustainable future","communications","connectivity","cybersecurity","enterprise-software","information technology","internet","mobile"],"company_annual_revenue_source_5":24770333789,"company_annual_revenue_currency_source_5":"USD","company_annual_revenue_source_1":247880007680.0,"company_annual_revenue_currency_source_1":"SEK","company_employees_count_change_yearly_percentage":-0.814835368109508,"company_last_funding_round_date":"2025-04-04","company_last_funding_round_amount_raised":null,"company_hq_full_address":"Torshamnsgatan 21;
