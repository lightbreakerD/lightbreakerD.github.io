I thrive in collaborative environments where ideas can evolve, and I contribute not only with technical expertise but also with strong communication and adaptability. My background spans molecular biology, cell culture, and data analysis, paired with a passion for transforming complex problems into practical solutions. After a period of professional reflection and personal growth, I’m more focused than ever on making meaningful contributions in the life sciences industry—where science meets real-world impact. (And beyond the lab, I run an online dance school—a creative outlet that fuels my energy, discipline, and connection with people.) Now, I’m ready to bring the full force of my skills, curiosity, and heart to an innovative industry team. I’m open to new roles in life sciences—particularly ones that value curiosity, communication, and heart. And I’m always building community through rhythm, resilience, and reinvention.
