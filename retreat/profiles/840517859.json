I bring hands-on experience from both academic and professional settings, including retail, volunteering, and student representation roles. Currently working at Sinsay (LPP) via Barona, where I’ve gained valuable customer service and retail operations experience. During my internship and subsequent employment, I’ve contributed to store performance, learned about fashion retail logistics, and developed strong teamwork and communication skills. I also represent my school as a student tutor and class representative(tiedottaja), where I support new students and handle communication efforts for student events and initiatives. These roles have helped me sharpen my public speaking, leadership, and event organization abilities. My international experience includes participating in the Model United Nations (MUN) in Lübeck, Germany, where I represented Sweden in the General Assembly’s Economic and Financial Committee. I successfully authored and defended a resolution that passed in the plenary session—an experience that enhanced my diplomacy, critical thinking, and negotiation skills. In 2024, I volunteered at Slush, one of Europe’s biggest startup events, where I supported the production help team. My responsibilities included handling electronic equipment logistics and ensuring smooth cooperation within a fast-paced, high-pressure environment. In 2025, I will proudly represent my school and country at EYE2025 (European Youth Event) in Strasbourg, further strengthening my interest in European affairs, youth engagement, and international cooperation. I’m an adaptive, quick learner and multilingual communicator with a strong drive to take on new challenges and grow professionally. Beyond school and work, I’ve participated in podcast projects highlighting student life, brain health, and literature—showing my interest in media and storytelling. Open to new opportunities in business, communications, or international projects where I can learn, contribute, and grow.","picture_url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E03AQEjq5RFrO1CiQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/B4EZVriwqZG0AY-/0/1741266030725?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=RMFopzloxtX1xw4eOxrGzhV9r9AERzRlNUa-CAoR47M","location_country":"Finland","location_country_iso2":"FI","location_country_iso3":"FIN","location_full":"Helsinki, Uusimaa, Finland","location_regions":["Europe","Northern Europe","EMEA","EU"],"location_city":"Helsinki","location_state":"Uusimaa","interests":[],"inferred_skills":["proactive","marketing","leadership","retail","volunteering","operations","fashion","logistics","teamwork","assembly","diplomacy","negotiation","production","cooperation","pressure","engagement","multilingual","projects","health","storytelling","communications","responsible","sales","reports","security","directing","high pressure environment","international business","customer service","fashion retail","communication skills","public speaking","critical thinking","negotiation skills","youth engagement","quick learner","business communications"],"historical_skills":[],"connections_count":207,"followers_count":213,"services":null,"primary_professional_email":null,"primary_professional_email_status":null,"professional_emails_collection":[],"is_working":1,"active_experience_company_id":98213048,"active_experience_title":null,"active_experience_description":null,"active_experience_department":null,"active_experience_management_level":null,"is_decision_maker":null,"total_experience_duration_months":27,"total_experience_duration_months_breakdown_department":[{"department":"Real Estate","total_experience_duration_months":9},{"department":"Customer Service","total_experience_duration_months":2},{"department":"Sales","total_experience_duration_months":14},{"department":"Operations","total_experience_duration_months":11}],"total_experience_duration_months_breakdown_management_level":[{"management_level":"Specialist","total_experience_duration_months":27}],"experience":[{"active_experience":1,"position_title":null,"department":null,"management_level":null,"location":"Helsinki, Uusimaa, Finland","description":null,"date_from":null,"date_from_year":null,"date_from_month":null,"date_to":null,"date_to_year":null,"date_to_month":null,"duration_months":null,"company_id":98213048,"company_name":"Akona Oy","company_type":"Privately Held","company_founded_year":null,"company_followers_count":10,"company_website":"https://www.akona.fi","company_facebook_url":[],"company_twitter_url":[],"company_linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/akona-oy","company_size_range":"1-10 employees","company_employees_count":4,"company_industry":"Accounting","company_categories_and_keywords":[],"company_annual_revenue_source_5":null,"company_annual_revenue_currency_source_5":null,"company_annual_revenue_source_1":null,"company_annual_revenue_currency_source_1":null,"company_employees_count_change_yearly_percentage":null,"company_last_funding_round_date":null,"company_last_funding_round_amount_raised":null,"company_hq_full_address":"Pursilahdenranta 2; LT1; Helsinki, Uusimaa 00980, FI","company_hq_country":"Finland","company_hq_regions":["Europe","Northern Europe","EMEA","EU"],"company_hq_country_iso2":"FI","company_hq_country_iso3":"FIN","company_hq_city":null,"company_hq_state":null,"company_hq_street":null,"company_hq_zipcode":null,"company_last_updated_at":"2025-11-06","company_stock_ticker":[],"company_is_b2b":null,"order_in_profile":1},{"active_experience":1,"position_title":"Responsible Salesperson","department":"Real Estate","management_level":"Specialist","location":"Helsinki, Uusimaa, Finland","description":"I am responsible for sales activities in the evening shift, helping team members and excellent customer service. • Managing closing procedures, such as closing cash registers, preparing daily sales reports and managing security measures in the evening shift. • Managing and directing evening and closing shifts, ensuring smooth operations and adherence to company standards. • I make sure the shelves are stocked, the displays are visually appealing and the inventory is organized for the next day.
