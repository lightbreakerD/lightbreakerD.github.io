Biofilms are extremely competitive environments where microbial cells benefit from collective actions, which enhance their survival. When pathogens form biofilm and cause disease it becomes a serious biomedical challenge. Probiotic bacteria have a great potential for treatment and prevention of biofilm-related infections. In nature, most biofilms are extremely diverse, and coexistence in a biofilm allows different species to interact. Their symbiosis can be either cooperative, neutral or competitive and knowledge about interactions, positive as well as negative, might have great biomedical applications.

Dysbiosis in the vaginal niche furthermore impacts fertility and is associated with miscarriages and preterm birth, as well as with a higher susceptibility for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). BV affects up to 58% of women worldwide and is characterized by varying symptoms and the presence of an anaerobic mixed-species microbiota. Currently, neither effective prognostics nor therapeutics exist to tackle this challenge as standard treatment with antibiotics has a high recurrence rate as it effectively removes the infection, but does not restore a healthy microbiome. Vaginal communities dominated by Lactobacillus species are generally associated with health. Through metabolism of currently not fully known carbon sources lactobacilli produce lactic acid, which lowers the vaginal pH and excludes unwanted species. Ensuring a strong Lactobacillus colonization might therefore have therapeutic potential but the underlying mechanisms behind shifts between healthy and BV microbiomes are still poorly understood. In that connection, a more thorough understanding of the mode of action of the vaginal microbiota is essential. This study therefore investigates the metabolism of several vaginal Lactobacillus strains by examining their carbon source utilization via Analytical profile index (API) tests and Biolog experiments.
