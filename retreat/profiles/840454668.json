Additionally, being surrounded by talented builders and developers also created an incredible atmosphere over the weekend.\n\nMy team and I, Marcos Ramirez Joos , Amar Ribic , Jonas Jacob Biermann , took on the avi challenge. Optimise the process of new client intake at medical hospitals and clinics. Basically, making the process of new client arriving to understanding the patient and his medical history more efficient. How did we do this?\n\nWe built 2 solutions. One for the patient, another for the doctor. Our patient onboarding had easy and accessible steps for uploading the user\u2019s medical data.

For years, we were told that code would eat the world. And yet, walking through Munich (or Garching if you want the symbolism) today, it feels like the world is starting to eat code back.\n\nTwo years ago, when we led a \u20ac20M seed round in a company called Proxima Fusion it, nominally, seemed to be an investment into fusion. But to call it that would be like describing the moon landing as a good use of kerosene. \n\nIt was, more precisely, a belief that Europe hadn\u2019t forgotten to build what matters. Not in apps. Not in abstractions. But in people who still bend metal, build machines, and dare to alter physics. \n\nAt the time, it felt almost contrarian to believe that this continent, with its long winters and cautious investors, could still produce the kind of ambition that once powered its industrial age. But now, that belief is starting to look less na\u00efve.\n\nMunich is in the proof. TUM, LMU, and Max Planck students are quietly dropping out of academia to found companies instead of publishing papers. Siemens, BMW, and Airbus supply the industrial gravity. Something is shifting here and it feels less like Berlin in 2018 and more like Palo Alto in 1968. \n\nThis is what happens when engineers start dreaming again.\n\nYou see it everywhere:\n- Proxima Fusion - building machines that could give humanity infinite clean energy.\n- Helsing - creating AI that defends democracies.\n- The Exploration Company - bringing back the spirit of European spaceflight.\n- Isar Aerospace - building rockets to enable access.\n- Quantum Systems - fusing hardware, autonomy, and defense.\n- Hades Mining , Alpine Eagle , Manex AI , microagi , OSM , CedarDB , Neoways , CoBrowser - each proof that Europe is rediscovering its taste for hard problems.\n\n... and they don\u2019t behave like European startups. They behave like global companies that happen to be European.\n\nAt redalpine , we\u2019ve been betting on this intersection - software meeting science - for nearly two decades. When we started, there wasn\u2019t even a word for it. Now it\u2019s called \u201cDeepTech,\u201d though what\u2019s really happening is that the boundary between science and entrepreneurship is dissolving. \n\nAnd that, I think, is the quiet truth beneath all this noise about Europe \u201ccatching up.\u201d Europe doesn\u2019t need to become Silicon Valley. It just needs to remember what it once was. \n\nIf a next generation of global companies is born here, it will likely be in places like Munich and Zurich, built on a culture that still believes in precision, iteration, and patience - things Silicon Valley forgot when it traded atoms for ads.\n\nIf you\u2019re building at that intersection - let\u2019s talk. \ud83e\udd18","action":"Jonas Jacob Biermann liked this","order_in_profile":14},{"activity_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/robertwille_students-lectures-winterterm-activity-7382422967122812928-Xns1","title":"\ud83c\udf93 Welcome, #students of Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen !\ud83d\udc4b\n \nNext week marks the official start of #lectures for the #WinterTerm \u2014 and the start of numerous students into their first semester!\n\nToday, I had the pleasure of #welcoming some of you with a brief mini lecture on \u201cHighlights of Computer Science\u201d \u2014 a small teaser of what\u2019s to come.\n\n\ud83d\ude4f A big thank you to the Fachschaft Mathematik/Physik/Informatik/Chemie ( #MPIC ) for organizing this as part of the Studieneinf\u00fchrungstage \u2014 the orientation days for new students at #TUM .\n\nWishing everyone a fantastic start into the #semester .

We also went on numerous excursions: to Nowa Huta, a district created under the Six-Year Plan of the communists, visits to old factories, shelters, and conversations with the Solidarity trade union.\n\n\ud83d\udd38 Krak\u00f3w \u2013 a City of Many Facets\nKrak\u00f3w revealed itself to us from different angles: from the historic old town with its churches, castles, and art, to the Jewish quarter, the former ghetto, and Schindler\u2019s Factory. Each tour opened up new perspectives.\n\n\ud83d\udd38 Auschwitz \u2013 an Experience That Leaves a Mark\nWhat moved me most deeply was the visit to Auschwitz. Despite all I had already learned through books, documentaries, workshops, and my own engagement against antisemitism, I could not hold back my tears. Standing in those rooms, seeing those images, makes you grasp the sheer magnitude of horror in a way nothing else can. It leaves you with a deep sense of responsibility: to make sure that such suffering never happens again.\n\nThis study academy was far more than just an exchange program. It was an intense learning journey that enriched me with new language skills, deeper historical understanding, and invaluable encounters.\n\n\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb A heartfelt thank you to the Hans B\u00f6ckler Foundation for making this unforgettable experience possible.","action":"Jonas Jacob Biermann liked this","order_in_profile":18},{"activity_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/wunderfund-llc_if-your-idea-of-a-good-time-includes-tweaking-activity-7375892378689249280-kzMJ","title":"If your idea of a good time includes tweaking R\u00b2 at 3 a.m., this is for you. \ud83e\udd13 \nWe launched the Wunder RNN Challenge for those who train neural networks at work, after work, and sometimes instead of work (+weekends). \n\nYou\u2019re invited to create a model that predicts the next market state from a sequence of previous states.\n\n\u2192 Timeline: September 15 \u2014 December 1\n\u2192 Prize pool: $13,600 USDT\n\nThis is the kind of challenge quants face every day.
