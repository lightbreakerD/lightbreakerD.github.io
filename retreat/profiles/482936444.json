When I turned 12, I started learning to code in Java and built my first projects, such as an AirDrop clone for Windows or a duplicate finder. During the pandemic, I got into machine learning and trained my own ML models, from simple image classifiers, to sequence-to-sequence models for text prediction. I was so annoyed by boring homework that I developed my own iOS app in 2021 for solving them automatically. I also built an electric go-kart that can steer itself using computer vision and developed a small app for controlling it. In March 2024, I co-founded Claid Technologies, where we are developing an assistant for lawyers that automates their mundane day-to-day tasks - from drafting simple emails all the way to complex legal research, reasoning and document editing.","picture_url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D03AQEKMabvfuAPKw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/B4DZbtUG27G8AY-/0/1747738194085?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=RoEZj37NDCkV3dt_qK39NALXsWY2hTLC8ZffDYyT5pU","location_country":"Germany","location_country_iso2":"DE","location_country_iso3":"DEU","location_full":"Munich,
