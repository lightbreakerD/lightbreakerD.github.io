I specialize in the TypeScript ecosystem, building high-performance, user-centric applications with clean architecture and rapid iteration. Having worked in fast-moving, highly regulated domains like KYC, compliance, and risk management, I understand the balance between speed, security, and auditability. In startups, requirements shift, constraints evolve, and execution speed matters. I take a pragmatic, LEAN approach to software—delivering value early, iterating fast, and adapting to real-world feedback. At Avallone, I’ve tackled compliance automation, risk assessment, and regulatory workflows, ensuring businesses can operate confidently in complex environments. I thrive in high-caliber engineering teams that embrace adaptability, customer obsession, and a bias for action. I love solving hard problems, engineering for trust and compliance, and building software that truly moves the needle.","picture_url":"https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/9c8pery4andzj6ohjkjp54ma2","location_country":"Denmark","location_country_iso2":"DK","location_country_iso3":"DNK","location_full":"Copenhagen, Capital Region of Denmark, Denmark","location_regions":["Europe","Northern Europe","EMEA","EU"],"location_city":"Copenhagen","location_state":"Capital Region of Denmark","interests":[],"inferred_skills":["engineering","typescript","architecture","kyc","compliance","risk","management","security","lean","software","automation","assessment","adaptability","risk management","risk assessment"],"historical_skills":[],"connections_count":500,"followers_count":811,"services":null,"primary_professional_email":null,"primary_professional_email_status":null,"professional_emails_collection":[],"is_working":1,"active_experience_company_id":11862766,"active_experience_title":"Co-Founder","active_experience_description":null,"active_experience_department":"C-Suite","active_experience_management_level":"Founder","is_decision_maker":1,"total_experience_duration_months":109,"total_experience_duration_months_breakdown_department":[{"department":"Engineering and Technical","total_experience_duration_months":109},{"department":"C-Suite","total_experience_duration_months":12}],"total_experience_duration_months_breakdown_management_level":[{"management_level":"Founder","total_experience_duration_months":12},{"management_level":"Specialist","total_experience_duration_months":107},{"management_level":"Senior","total_experience_duration_months":28},{"management_level":"Intern","total_experience_duration_months":2}],"experience":[{"active_experience":1,"position_title":"Co-Founder","department":"C-Suite","management_level":"Founder","location":"Copenhagen, Capital Region of Denmark, Denmark","description":null,"date_from":"May 2025","date_from_year":2025,"date_from_month":5,"date_to":null,"date_to_year":null,"date_to_month":null,"duration_months":6,"company_id":11862766,"company_name":"Stealth Startup","company_type":"Privately Held","company_founded_year":null,"company_followers_count":1395388,"company_website":"https://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stealth_startup","company_facebook_url":[],"company_twitter_url":[],"company_linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/stealth-startup-51","company_size_range":"11-50 employees","company_employees_count":28164,"company_industry":"Technology, Information and Internet","company_categories_and_keywords":["startup","silence","marketing strategy","outsiders","stealth","startup company"],"company_annual_revenue_source_5":null,"company_annual_revenue_currency_source_5":null,"company_annual_revenue_source_1":null,"company_annual_revenue_currency_source_1":null,"company_employees_count_change_yearly_percentage":30.759464973928814,"company_last_funding_round_date":null,"company_last_funding_round_amount_raised":null,"company_hq_full_address":"San Francisco, California, US","company_hq_country":"United States","company_hq_regions":["Americas","Northern America","AMER"],"company_hq_country_iso2":"US","company_hq_country_iso3":"USA","company_hq_city":"San Francisco","company_hq_state":"California","company_hq_street":"","company_hq_zipcode":"","company_last_updated_at":"2025-11-05","company_stock_ticker":[],"company_is_b2b":0,"order_in_profile":1},{"active_experience":1,"position_title":"Co-Founder","department":"C-Suite","management_level":"Founder","location":"Copenhagen, Capital Region of Denmark, Denmark","description":null,"date_from":"November 2024","date_from_year":2024,"date_from_month":11,"date_to":null,"date_to_year":null,"date_to_month":null,"duration_months":12,"company_id":98286298,"company_name":"Guidly","company_type":"Self-Employed","company_founded_year":null,"company_followers_count":170,"company_website":"https://www.guidly.eu","company_facebook_url":[],"company_twitter_url":[],"company_linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/askguidly","company_size_range":"1-10 employees","company_employees_count":6,"company_industry":"Software Development","company_categories_and_keywords":[],"company_annual_revenue_source_5":null,"company_annual_revenue_currency_source_5":null,"company_annual_revenue_source_1":null,"company_annual_revenue_currency_source_1":null,"company_employees_count_change_yearly_percentage":null,"company_last_funding_round_date":null,"company_last_funding_round_amount_raised":null,"company_hq_full_address":"Centrifugevej 374;
