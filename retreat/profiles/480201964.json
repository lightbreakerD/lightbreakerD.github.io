Over the past few years, my journey has taken me from building startup communities at Buildit VC and Startup Estonia to implementing cross-border innovation programs that support founders and changemakers at Baltic Innovation Agency. Along the way, I’ve learned how to make sense of complex stakeholder needs, use data and research to guide decisions, and stay creative in ambiguity. 💡 I’m endlessly curious and love figuring things out, whether it’s designing, testing, and launching new ideas, improving how processes work, or experimenting with tools I haven’t tried yet. I’m driven by the challenge of making ideas tangible and watching them create value for people. 🔎 Outside of work, you’ll probably find me catching up on my reading and watch lists, discovering music, or falling down a rabbit hole of something new I’m learning. 👋 Simply send me a quick ‘Hi’ message, and I’ll be glad to chat and exchange thoughts with you.","picture_url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5603AQFtFJ6khR-B0g/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/B56ZSP37.BGQAY-/0/1737580593720?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=nMM6uAjL5VcjcgohZzTN75YqhH1HLA0f1yp1LWnHitI","location_country":"Estonia","location_country_iso2":"EE","location_country_iso3":"EST","location_full":"Tartu, Tartumaa, Estonia","location_regions":["Europe","Northern Europe","EMEA","EU"],"location_city":"Tartu","location_state":"Tartumaa","interests":[],"inferred_skills":["innovation","research","creative","designing","testing","marketing","ut","engagement","facebook","collaboration","storytelling","design","messaging","communications","digital","instagram","twitter","newsletters","stories","organized","strategy","investors","analytics","campaigns","driving","rates","projects","ngos","project manager","international marketing","social media","visual design","content creation","media strategy","marketing communications","marketing communication","content strategy","community engagement"],"historical_skills":[],"connections_count":500,"followers_count":24,"services":null,"primary_professional_email":null,"primary_professional_email_status":null,"professional_emails_collection":[],"is_working":1,"active_experience_company_id":279207,"active_experience_title":null,"active_experience_description":null,"active_experience_department":null,"active_experience_management_level":null,"is_decision_maker":null,"total_experience_duration_months":51,"total_experience_duration_months_breakdown_department":[{"department":"Consulting","total_experience_duration_months":38},{"department":"Marketing","total_experience_duration_months":37},{"department":"Other","total_experience_duration_months":5}],"total_experience_duration_months_breakdown_management_level":[{"management_level":"Intern","total_experience_duration_months":6},{"management_level":"Manager","total_experience_duration_months":40},{"management_level":"Other","total_experience_duration_months":5}],"experience":[{"active_experience":1,"position_title":null,"department":null,"management_level":null,"location":"Tartu, Tartumaa, Estonia","description":null,"date_from":null,"date_from_year":null,"date_from_month":null,"date_to":null,"date_to_year":null,"date_to_month":null,"duration_months":null,"company_id":279207,"company_name":"Baltic Innovation Agency","company_type":"Privately Held","company_founded_year":2003,"company_followers_count":503,"company_website":"https://www.bia.ee","company_facebook_url":[],"company_twitter_url":[],"company_linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/baltic-innovation-agency","company_size_range":"1-10 employees","company_employees_count":11,"company_industry":"Business Consulting and Services","company_categories_and_keywords":["innovation management","- -","business plans","market research","feasibility studies","funding proposals","technology and partner searches","startup consulting","cluster development","technology transfer","business development","investment readiness","people","ideas","connections","money"],"company_annual_revenue_source_5":null,"company_annual_revenue_currency_source_5":null,"company_annual_revenue_source_1":null,"company_annual_revenue_currency_source_1":null,"company_employees_count_change_yearly_percentage":27.27272727272727,"company_last_funding_round_date":null,"company_last_funding_round_amount_raised":null,"company_hq_full_address":"Lai 30; Tartu, 51005, EE","company_hq_country":"Estonia","company_hq_regions":["Europe","Northern Europe","EMEA","EU"],"company_hq_country_iso2":"EE","company_hq_country_iso3":"EST","company_hq_city":null,"company_hq_state":null,"company_hq_street":null,"company_hq_zipcode":null,"company_last_updated_at":"2025-11-06","company_stock_ticker":[],"company_is_b2b":1,"order_in_profile":1},{"active_experience":0,"position_title":"Marketing Communications Manager","department":"Marketing","management_level":"Manager","location":"Riga, Latvia","description":"Buildit VC is an early-stage venture fund investing in Industry 4.0 startups across the Nordics and Baltics, helping companies scale from early development to market leadership.

They also provide chargeable laboratory services for assessing water quality. As part of the Digital Product Management Industry Project course of the Delta Sandbox program at the University of Tartu, we collaborated with the Estonian Health Board for a multi-faceted project focused on presenting various stakeholders with access to environmental health data for personal awareness and research purposes in an efficient, user-friendly, and interactive way as well as updating and modernizing internal data collection from business clients. To address the challenge of accessibility, fragmentation, and lack of awareness about environmental health data, we prototyped a possible redesign of the current website to make it more interactive, user-friendly, and integrated with all the background business-related processes. On the other hand, we also tackled the issue of the time-consuming and error-prone manual data entry process that causes delays in data availability. Our team developed business process maps for both water quality and mobile operator areas of the Estonian Health Board, which included pointers to improve the speed of internal business processes that slow down data entry and collection.
