By implementing matrix multiplication in ASIC allows us to take advantage of parallelism and high memory bandwidth to improve performance sigificantly. The design is evaluated with synthesis constraints on speed and area, using 65 nm standard cell library. The input matrix is 4x8 and the coefficient matrix is 8x4. The design utilizes only four multiplier units and is implmented in VHDL 2002. QuestaSim is used for simulation, Genus/ for synthesus and Cadence Innovus for Placement and routing.
