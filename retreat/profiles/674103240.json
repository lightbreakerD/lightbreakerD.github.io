With a Bachelor’s in Chemical Engineering from Shiv Nadar University and hands-on research experience in bioenergy, CO₂ capture, and hydrogen storage, I am now pursuing an MSc in Sustainable Energy Technologies at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). During my undergraduate studies, my research on biomass pyrolysis, developed practical skills in biochar and bio-oil production, and their characterization completed a thesis focused on bioenergy applications. My experiences as a Research Intern at IISc Bengaluru and IIT Hyderabad further enhanced my laboratory skills, analytical skills, and teamwork skills. Beyond academics, I have served in multiple leadership and advisory roles at Shiv Nadar University, including as Advisor and Secretary of the H2O Society, senator and as a member of both finance and placement committees. These experiences have sharpened my teamwork, project management, communication, and organizational abilities. I am eager to collaborate with like-minded professionals and organizations to innovate in sustainable energy, and working on topics like bioenergy, Biogas upgrading, and CO2 capture. Let’s connect if you share a vision for a cleaner, more sustainable future. Apart from all these, I enjoy cricket, badminton, and music. These activities that keep me balanced, focused, and motivated.","picture_url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5603AQEDvk8MuqQ-rw/profile-displayphoto-scale_200_200/B56Zk6GSmLHQAY-/0/1757616353392?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=sNyWEd1rLzvKIFejmLUiO04k8vO_USUAGHTfl7GkDhc","location_country":"Denmark","location_country_iso2":"DK","location_country_iso3":"DNK","location_full":"Copenhagen,
