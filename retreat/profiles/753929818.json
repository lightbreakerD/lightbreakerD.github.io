As he, rightfully, pointed out, we have pushed technology into schools for decades, but it never really changed how we educate. The new AI technologies will bring in those changes and we have to work together on developing our pedagogy. Thank you Mick! It was great to see you again. \n\nI must extend my sincere gratitude to Oahn Crouch Daniel Jones , Adam Hassoun , Harry Ainscough  Dominic Abbott, Suzannah and Chris Long for their unwavering commitment and innovative thinking. You constantly impress me, I am so delighted to work with you, and your contributions and leadership are invaluable as we navigate the future of AI in education together.\n\nLooking ahead, I am excited about my visit to Cambridge House British International School on Monday. It presents a fantastic opportunity to work closely with parents, pupils, teachers, and the leadership team on furthering our partnership in AI integration and the safe use of technology. These dialogues are critical for shaping an educational environment that is not only technologically advanced but also secure and nurturing for our students.\n\nMoreover, I want to congratulate Cambridge House on the remarkable achievements at the Cambridge International Education awards ceremony. Wow! 🤩 The sweeping victories across multiple categories stand as a testament to our amazing pupils, exceptional teachers, and the high standards of the Globeducate community. \n\nThank you to everyone involved in the NABSS Conference for creating an insightful and productive gathering.
