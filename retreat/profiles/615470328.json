I enjoy working on complex environmental challenges, especially those that involve rethinking waste, scaling climate solutions, and enabling real-world impact. Whether it’s transforming sanitary waste into resources, advancing the circular economy, or exploring carbon finance and CCUS, I’m focused on building a future that’s bold, green, and grounded in science. I’ve co-authored a peer-reviewed journal article on resource recovery from sanitary waste, developed sustainability tools, and helped win a national hackathon focused on repurposing depleting oil &amp; gas assets into clean energy hubs. 💡 What drives me? The belief that waste isn't waste - it's just untapped potential. If you're building solutions in climate tech, carbon markets, or renewable energy - let’s connect and turn bold ideas into real impact. 🌍♻️","picture_url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5603AQGC4pyJaHHoFA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0/1712593013211?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=wA60o4roL3TuaQc7gBrJ0-8GgmmHU4-wPu1XhBHxID8","location_country":"Sweden","location_country_iso2":"SE","location_country_iso3":"SWE","location_full":"Stockholm, Stockholm County, Sweden","location_regions":["Europe","Northern Europe","EMEA","EU"],"location_city":"Stockholm","location_state":"Stockholm County","interests":[],"inferred_skills":["engineering","sustainability","carbon","energy","environmental","finance","green","science","oil","chemical engineering","renewable energy"],"historical_skills":[],"connections_count":500,"followers_count":64,"services":null,"primary_professional_email":null,"primary_professional_email_status":null,"professional_emails_collection":[],"is_working":null,"active_experience_company_id":null,"active_experience_title":null,"active_experience_description":null,"active_experience_department":null,"active_experience_management_level":null,"is_decision_maker":null,"total_experience_duration_months":36,"total_experience_duration_months_breakdown_department":[{"department":"Other","total_experience_duration_months":28},{"department":"Marketing","total_experience_duration_months":18},{"department":"C-Suite","total_experience_duration_months":17}],"total_experience_duration_months_breakdown_management_level":[{"management_level":"Specialist","total_experience_duration_months":35},{"management_level":"President/Vice President","total_experience_duration_months":17},{"management_level":"Intern","total_experience_duration_months":2}],"experience":[{"active_experience":0,"position_title":"Advisory Committee","department":"Other","management_level":"Specialist","location":null,"description":null,"date_from":"July 2024","date_from_year":2024,"date_from_month":7,"date_to":"April 2025","date_to_year":2025,"date_to_month":4,"duration_months":9,"company_id":9174076,"company_name":"AIChE - American Institute of Chemical Engineers","company_type":"Nonprofit","company_founded_year":1908,"company_followers_count":121845,"company_website":"https://www.aiche.org","company_facebook_url":["https://www.facebook.com/chenected","https://www.facebook.com/aiche"],"company_twitter_url":["https://www.twitter.com/aiche_ku","https://www.twitter.com/chenected"],"company_linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/american-institute-of-chemical-engineers","company_size_range":"51-200 employees","company_employees_count":1747,"company_industry":"Non-profit Organizations","company_categories_and_keywords":["chemical engineering","chemical process safety","biological engineering","sustainability","energy","divisions","chemical engineers","environmental","forums","education","non profit"],"company_annual_revenue_source_5":47278237,"company_annual_revenue_currency_source_5":"USD","company_annual_revenue_source_1":null,"company_annual_revenue_currency_source_1":null,"company_employees_count_change_yearly_percentage":23.345195729537366,"company_last_funding_round_date":"2024-03-13","company_last_funding_round_amount_raised":50000000,"company_hq_full_address":"120 Wall Street;
