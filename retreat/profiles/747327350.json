By simulating a precise diamond geometry, we present theoretical examinations of hyperfine interaction between a 13C nuclear spins and an NV- electron to study the properties of weakly and strongly coupled nuclear spins, such as its spatial distribution and its total count in a given lattice. Furthermore, we perform studies based on such a framework on the spin flip rate of a 13C by virtue of electron flips as well as the direction of nuclear spin axis, a 13C spin assumes due to the influence of an external magnetic field and a dipole magnetic field of the NV- electron. Based on a given hyperfine threshold and minimum angle of nuclear spin condition, we define the criteria for a suitable 13C spin and evaluate its count, properties and statistical variations through the generation of 1000 diamond supercell lattices and also in its optimal configuration which yielded a total of 22 13C spin at 2 T of external magnetic field.
