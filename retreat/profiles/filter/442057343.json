Now, let’s dispense with formalities and stop pretending I did not write this myself. As a painter, I’m a portraitist first. My interest in people extends to the influence of their surroundings, their internal turmoil, their excuses and humane weaknesses, their achievements and iron resolve. Through that, a painting comes alive. This portraiture is caught between intimacy and exposure, between the feeling of being looked at and looking back, the desire to be seen and the discomfort that accompanies it. Frustrated by the structural problems of Europe’s cultural sector, I founded De Structura, an organisation that supports emerging art professionals and carries out cross-innovation projects. With our team and partners we attempt to do things differently.","picture_url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D03AQF1kAtvnzXRnw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0/1710246356239?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=yXtGYXSKuxDSxhc-ADyTEv_EKnQiYyNoq6qU32O0mTE","location_country":"Estonia","location_country_iso2":"EE","location_country_iso3":"EST","location_full":"Tallinn, Harjumaa, Estonia","location_regions":["Europe","Northern Europe","EMEA","EU"],"location_city":"Tallinn","location_state":"Harjumaa","interests":[],"inferred_skills":["human rights","community building","innovation","painting","organisation","projects","basecamp","education","creative","r","energy","health","artist","director","restructuring","partnerships","pr","fundraising"],"historical_skills":[],"connections_count":500,"followers_count":26,"services":null,"primary_professional_email":null,"primary_professional_email_status":null,"professional_emails_collection":[],"is_working":null,"active_experience_company_id":null,"active_experience_title":null,"active_experience_description":null,"active_experience_department":null,"active_experience_management_level":null,"is_decision_maker":null,"total_experience_duration_months":222,"total_experience_duration_months_breakdown_department":[{"department":"Marketing","total_experience_duration_months":11},{"department":"Other","total_experience_duration_months":11},{"department":"Sales","total_experience_duration_months":82},{"department":"Project Management","total_experience_duration_months":12},{"department":"C-Suite","total_experience_duration_months":101},{"department":"Education","total_experience_duration_months":15},{"department":"Design","total_experience_duration_months":90}],"total_experience_duration_months_breakdown_management_level":[{"management_level":"Intern","total_experience_duration_months":6},{"management_level":"Specialist","total_experience_duration_months":143},{"management_level":"Other","total_experience_duration_months":5},{"management_level":"Founder","total_experience_duration_months":56},{"management_level":"Manager","total_experience_duration_months":15},{"management_level":"Director","total_experience_duration_months":23},{"management_level":"C-Level","total_experience_duration_months":25},{"management_level":"President/Vice President","total_experience_duration_months":14}],"experience":[{"active_experience":0,"position_title":"Executive Committee Member","department":"C-Suite","management_level":"C-Level","location":"Lyon, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, France","description":"Setting the strategic course for the newest and youngest Creative Europe network for independent culture and media organisations with a specific focus on advocacy and governance structures.","date_from":"August 2023","date_from_year":2023,"date_from_month":8,"date_to":"September 2025","date_to_year":2025,"date_to_month":9,"duration_months":25,"company_id":93568367,"company_name":"Reset! network","company_type":"Nonprofit","company_founded_year":2022,"company_followers_count":3077,"company_website":"https://www.linktr.ee/reset_network","company_facebook_url":[],"company_twitter_url":[],"company_linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/resetnetwork","company_size_range":"201-500 employees","company_employees_count":14,"company_industry":"Non-profit Organizations","company_categories_and_keywords":["media","european network","spaces","digital practices","media organizations","independent cultural"],"company_annual_revenue_source_5":null,"company_annual_revenue_currency_source_5":null,"company_annual_revenue_source_1":null,"company_annual_revenue_currency_source_1":null,"company_employees_count_change_yearly_percentage":54.54545454545454,"company_last_funding_round_date":null,"company_last_funding_round_amount_raised":null,"company_hq_full_address":null,"company_hq_country":null,"company_hq_regions":[],"company_hq_country_iso2":null,"company_hq_country_iso3":null,"company_hq_city":null,"company_hq_state":null,"company_hq_street":null,"company_hq_zipcode":null,"company_last_updated_at":"2025-11-06","company_stock_ticker":[],"company_is_b2b":0,"order_in_profile":1},{"active_experience":0,"position_title":"Basecamp Member - Fellows Community","department":null,"management_level":null,"location":"Lucerne, Switzerland","description":"Lucerne Dialogue connects European leaders of tomorrow by inviting 50 selected future leaders (25-45 years old) from all over Europe to participate in the Basecamp programme in Lucerne.
