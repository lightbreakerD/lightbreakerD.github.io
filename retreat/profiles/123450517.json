scholarship period at Lund University, funded by the Swedish Institute. This research explores the cultural representation, identity, and practices of young Vietnamese Americans through TikTok. The primary argument is that social media plays a critical role in facilitating cultural exchange and cultivating a sense of belonging for young immigrants living far away from their ancestral homelands. The study focuses on the main theoretical discussions on culture in mediated space, migration, and media representation, as well as the construction of the youthful sense of self on social media, to guide these aims. The research questions focus on the role that TikTok plays in the formation and expression of the cultural identity of young Vietnamese immigrants and the reactions of the audience to these representations. The study uses a critical realism approach, which recognizes the importance of social environment, culture, and power relations in shaping research outcomes. The research employs a case study research method, which is useful for understanding the underlying social structures and power relations that shape the social phenomenon under investigation. Qualitative methods are used for data collection, including qualitative text analysis of TikTok videos and audience reactions, as well as netnographic observation. The researcher's involvement in collecting and analyzing the data is emphasized, as it enables the researcher to gain a unique perspective on the cultural practices of young Vietnamese Americans on TikTok.

During this educational excursion, students engage in immersive experiences, including staying in the homes of ethnic communities and conducting interviews with local residents and authorities, when necessary. Each research team, composed of 2-3 students from diverse backgrounds, is tasked with exploring a range of societal issues such as education, gender equality, women's roles, culture, economic development, and healthcare. The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of these issues through direct interaction and research in the field. Our research team embarked on a study titled \"Coming of Age at the Rice Wine Table.\" This qualitative field study focuses on the youth and drinking culture prevalent in the northern Vietnamese uplands. In this research, we examine the significance of drinking as a social and cultural phenomenon, emphasizing its communal aspects rather than viewing it solely as a means of intoxication.Based on observations when staying in ethnic people's houses and interviews with local people and authority (if necessary), each research team (2-3 mixed students) are supposed to conduct a research on such issues as education, gender equality, women's role, culture, economic development, health care and so on. Our research team conducted a research titled \"Coming of age at the rice wine table\" - a qualitative field study on youth and drinking culture in the northen Vietnamese uplands. In this study, we deal with drinking as a social and cultural factor that gains its value primarily through its collective role, as opposed to as a means of intoxication only.
