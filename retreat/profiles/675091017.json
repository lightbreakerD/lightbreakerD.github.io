The title translates to English as follows: \"Pushing the Limits - Active Safety in Paragliding\". Please find a short summary below. Paragliding is a thrilling sport, but pilots often face hazardous flight situations leading to tragic accidents. This paper introduces a comprehensive approach to increase in-flight safety. Based on fundamental physical principles, new numerical models of specific flight situations have been developed. On this foundation, quantitative algorithms and data models for the thorough analysis of dangerous flight scenarios have been derived. Finally, software-driven simulation models have been implemented in a physical warning system that accurately predicts specific flight states. In summary, the findings and deliverables contribute to increased safety in paragliding and establish the technical foundation for further innovation as well as the commercialisation of the technology for the benefit of a wide audience of pilots in Europe and beyond.
