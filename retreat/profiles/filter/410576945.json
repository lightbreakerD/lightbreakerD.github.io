A few months ago, a friend convinced me to take on a challenging course in design-build for wind turbine competitions at DTU - Technical University of Denmark ( DTU Wind and Energy Systems ) with the motivating words, \"If not us, who can?\" Today, I am immensely grateful for that decision. 😊\n\nOver the past four months, I've been deeply involved in intense hands-on field engineering tasks. As part of our course objectives, we aimed to participate in the International Small Wind Turbine Competitions (ISWTC) and Racing Aeolus in Holland. I took on the responsibility of DAQ and control for both HAWT and VAWT.\n\nFacing real-time issues, my primary task was to develop an active controller for HAWT and VAWT from scratch. This involved creating, developing, and testing a new variable pitch controller by measuring wind speeds and RPM to find the optimal TSR in the wind tunnel testing facility at Delft University of Technology organized by Hanze University of applied science. For VAWT, I was able to control the cyclic pitch with phase and amplitude pitching operations to find the optimal TSR and explore different possibilities for pitching out the blades. 💡\n\nWith unwavering guidance from our professors and incredible team effort, we achieved an electrical Cp of 0.408, and with the cut-in in low wind speed (3 m/s) and executed variable pitching operations to reach the optimal TSR using our active controller. Additionally, our new aerodynamic winglet blades proved to be a game-changer. 🚀\n\nOur hard work and innovation led us to receive two prestigious international recognitions: \n🏆 BEST ANNUAL ENERGY PRODUCTION (AEP) AWARD - 2024 for Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine \n🏆 BEST OVERALL PERFORMANCE AWARD - 2024 for Vertical Axis Wind Turbine\n\nI would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to Robert Mikkelsen , Taeseong Kim , and Mac Gaunaa for their constant guidance. A special thank you to my friend A RAMAKRISHNAN , who encouraged me to take this leap, and to all my fellow teammates for their dedication and support. \n\nLooking forward to more such exhilarating challenges and accomplishments! Next year, I will be designing the automatic independent pitch controller, and I can't wait to see what we achieve! 🌍💨⚙️ #WindTurbine #Engineering #Innovation #RenewableEnergy #TeamWork #ISWTC #RacingAeolus #DTUWind #DTU","action":"Madheshwaran Lakshmipathy shared this","order_in_profile":8},{"activity_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/madheshwaran-lakshmipathy_globalwindday-globalwindday-windenergy-activity-7207718160253218816-vC4j","title":"🌍 Happy #GlobalWindDay ! 🌬️\n\nAbout a year ago, I took a leap of faith and moved to Denmark to dive into the world of wind energy.

The novelty of this project is that it has a well developed strategy for skin cancer detection using high performance image based machine learning algorithms to execute intensity level adjustment at the preprocessing stage followed by segmentation and feature extraction from the region of interest, the lesion on the skin surface. This method uses images from the open source data base like DermIS and DermQuest. The preprocessing includes filtering and edge detection. For this purpose, convolution is used to remove the noise present followed by extraction of Highly Perceptive Features (HPF) like colour, irregularity, boundaries, shape and diameter. The correlation coefficients play an important role to determine the effectiveness in identifying the skin tumor and serves as a unique measure to identify the distinct input feature set for training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) so as to identify the malignant tumor on the skin surface.
