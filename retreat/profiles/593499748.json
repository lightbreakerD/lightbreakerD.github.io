With experience across startups, global corporates (P&amp;G), and NGOs (AIESEC), I thrive at the intersection of creativity and strategy. I’ve managed product development for EdTech startups, led brand launches across Central Asia, and mentored early-stage founders on go-to-market and fundraising. My approach is a mix of analytical thinking and user-centric mindset; no matter if this is planning a sprint, structuring a pitch deck, or running a design workshop. I love bringing creative solutions to life. Let’s build something that matters.","picture_url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E03AQHgA80l1fUKqA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0/1714384874393?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=GmqM_z_ZErQRj9DD1wJEYIDeWve4DK8O_spe_Sxvrjg","location_country":"Sweden","location_country_iso2":"SE","location_country_iso3":"SWE","location_full":"Sweden","location_regions":["Europe","Northern Europe","EMEA","EU"],"location_city":null,"location_state":null,"interests":[],"inferred_skills":["technology","innovation","p","ngos","strategy","fundraising","planning","running","design","creative","b2c","investments","analysis","performing","research","management","ux","sales","commerce","optimization","business innovation","product development","creative solutions","project manager","business development","due diligence","market research","decision making","brand management","cost savings","user research","sales analysis","strategic planning"],"historical_skills":[],"connections_count":500,"followers_count":2370,"services":null,"primary_professional_email":null,"primary_professional_email_status":null,"professional_emails_collection":[],"is_working":null,"active_experience_company_id":null,"active_experience_title":null,"active_experience_description":null,"active_experience_department":null,"active_experience_management_level":null,"is_decision_maker":null,"total_experience_duration_months":46,"total_experience_duration_months_breakdown_department":[{"department":"Sales","total_experience_duration_months":5},{"department":"Other","total_experience_duration_months":28},{"department":"Research","total_experience_duration_months":4},{"department":"C-Suite","total_experience_duration_months":22},{"department":"Project Management","total_experience_duration_months":2},{"department":"Operations","total_experience_duration_months":1}],"total_experience_duration_months_breakdown_management_level":[{"management_level":"Other","total_experience_duration_months":26},{"management_level":"Manager","total_experience_duration_months":8},{"management_level":"Specialist","total_experience_duration_months":4},{"management_level":"President/Vice President","total_experience_duration_months":22},{"management_level":"Intern","total_experience_duration_months":2}],"experience":[{"active_experience":0,"position_title":"Venture Analyst (Product Owner In Venture Studio)","department":null,"management_level":null,"location":null,"description":"- Defined product requirements, user stories, and sprint plans for early-stage EdTech and SaaS startups - Led user research, mapped journeys, and refined UX features - Collaborated across teams to implement agile workflows using Trello, Notion, and Jira","date_from":"April 2025","date_from_year":2025,"date_from_month":4,"date_to":"June 2025","date_to_year":2025,"date_to_month":6,"duration_months":2,"company_id":82601130,"company_name":"SABAH.HUB","company_type":"Partnership","company_founded_year":2021,"company_followers_count":13542,"company_website":"https://www.sabahhub.com","company_facebook_url":["https://www.facebook.com/sabah.hub.ic"],"company_twitter_url":["https://www.twitter.com/sabahhub_ic"],"company_linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/sabahhub1","company_size_range":"51-200 employees","company_employees_count":134,"company_industry":"Venture Capital and Private Equity Principals","company_categories_and_keywords":["technology/startup","startups","mvp production","fundraising","idea validation","innovation center","business development","training","tutoring"],"company_annual_revenue_source_5":null,"company_annual_revenue_currency_source_5":null,"company_annual_revenue_source_1":null,"company_annual_revenue_currency_source_1":null,"company_employees_count_change_yearly_percentage":17.543859649122805,"company_last_funding_round_date":null,"company_last_funding_round_amount_raised":null,"company_hq_full_address":"Bayıl Bay Qurban Abbasov 5;
