During that time I created around 60 paintings (watercolours, oil pastels, oil colours) and drawings as well as sketches. I was specifically interested in understanding the colours and materials I work with, to have more control in order to add more authenticity and individuality. So I studied Doerner’s classic “Malmaterial und seine Verwendung im Bilde”. Some of the oil colours I use are hence self-made with finest pigments, in order to achieve cleaner and more individual colours and I adapted a recipe of a canvas grounding from the old masters. I interned at Kremer Pigmente in Munich to further foster my understanding of working with pigments. Impressionism such as Monet influenced my works a great deal, I read different biographies about him and was looking multiple years for a (near-)complete compilation of Monet’s works. I’ve found it when I was participating in nude drawing classes at Munich’s Academy of Art 2019-20. At the age of 13 I had the opportunity to host a solo exhibition in my community with around 80 guests at the vernissage, including an opening by the mayor. I enjoy painting things I like, things which I think are beautiful or distinctive. Most of the time I paint places or things that mean something to me. An example could be my panama hat, but also nature around my hometown or other countries and urban life in the city. My pursuit is to create a colourful, shimmering, atmospheric impression of the subject. When I look at my paintings, they remind me of the feelings I have for the subject.
