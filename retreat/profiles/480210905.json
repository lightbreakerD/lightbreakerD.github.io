Is development, in a traditional sense, always the right way forward? Having grown up in Ghana, Finland and the UK respectively, I've gained insight into domestic and international systems that work, and into ones that don't. Sustainable Development, Environmental conservation, Climate Change, Renewable Energy Initiatives, Human Development, and International Affairs all fuse together into a hopeful yet seemingly impossible vision of a sustainable future that motivates me to keep investigating both realistic and ambitious approaches moving forward. My experiences in research, NGO work, policy analysis and travel have exposed to me the effects of global development on the environment, and on disadvantaged communities worldwide. Every element and system of society needs to transition and adapt to Climate Change mitigation in a rapidly changing world. Identifying and studying this transition at an interdisciplinary level is crucial and I hope that my perspective continues to expand with future experience and with the help of people I meet along the way. I am fascinated by that which I do not understand. If you would like to discuss issues or solutions or simply have a conversation about sustainability, politics, climate change or anything else, please don't hesitate to reach out; I'd love to hear from you!","picture_url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D03AQG4LKqjUxQ-hw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0/1687775029833?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=wpAnmzUyIeHB_XoQZxg8mTL_5UBzJ0fSKsx2prFy6F0","location_country":"Finland","location_country_iso2":"FI","location_country_iso3":"FIN","location_full":"Espoo, Uusimaa, Finland","location_regions":["Europe","Northern Europe","EMEA","EU"],"location_city":"Espoo","location_state":"Uusimaa","interests":[],"inferred_skills":["sustainable development","climate change","renewable energy","human development","policy analysis","sustainability","environmental","energy","research","analysis","mitigation"],"historical_skills":[],"connections_count":500,"followers_count":882,"services":null,"primary_professional_email":null,"primary_professional_email_status":null,"professional_emails_collection":[],"is_working":null,"active_experience_company_id":null,"active_experience_title":null,"active_experience_description":null,"active_experience_department":null,"active_experience_management_level":null,"is_decision_maker":null,"total_experience_duration_months":22,"total_experience_duration_months_breakdown_department":[{"department":"Research","total_experience_duration_months":3},{"department":"Other","total_experience_duration_months":5},{"department":"Education","total_experience_duration_months":22}],"total_experience_duration_months_breakdown_management_level":[{"management_level":"Other","total_experience_duration_months":5},{"management_level":"Intern","total_experience_duration_months":3},{"management_level":"Specialist","total_experience_duration_months":22}],"experience":[{"active_experience":0,"position_title":"Program Curator","department":"Education","management_level":"Specialist","location":"Helsinki Metropolitan Area","description":null,"date_from":"May 2023","date_from_year":2023,"date_from_month":5,"date_to":"October 2024","date_to_year":2024,"date_to_month":10,"duration_months":17,"company_id":4137338,"company_name":"Slush","company_type":"Nonprofit","company_founded_year":2008,"company_followers_count":94822,"company_website":"https://www.slush.org","company_facebook_url":["https://www.facebook.com/slushhq"],"company_twitter_url":["https://www.twitter.com/slushhq"],"company_linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/slush","company_size_range":"11-50 employees","company_employees_count":152,"company_industry":"Non-profit Organizations","company_categories_and_keywords":["hospitality/events","international","high-growth","startups","investors","seafood","hawaii","venues","cocktail","destination weddings","event management","events","internet","market research","non profit"],"company_annual_revenue_source_5":9500000,"company_annual_revenue_currency_source_5":"USD","company_annual_revenue_source_1":null,"company_annual_revenue_currency_source_1":null,"company_employees_count_change_yearly_percentage":3.205128205128205,"company_last_funding_round_date":"2013-10-16","company_last_funding_round_amount_raised":null,"company_hq_full_address":"Malminkatu 16;

Endemic in over 100 countries, the four types of leishmaniasis–visceral leishmaniasis (VL) (known as kala-azar), cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL), and post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL)–put 1.6 billion people at risk. In Kenya, the extent of leishmaniasis research has not yet been systematically described. This knowledge is instrumental in identifying existing research gaps and designing appropriate interventions for diagnosis, treatment, and elimination. This study used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology to determine the state of leishmaniases research in Kenya and identify research gaps. We searched seven online databases to identify articles published until January 2022 covering VL, CL, MCL, and/or PKDL in Kenya. A total of 7,486 articles were found, of which 479 underwent full-text screening, and 269 met our eligibility criteria. Most articles covered VL only (n = 141, 52%), were published between 1980 and 1994 (n = 108, 39%), and focused on the theme of “vectors” (n = 92, 34%). The most prevalent study types were “epidemiological research” (n = 88, 33%) tied with “clinical research” (n = 88, 33%), then “basic science research” (n = 49, 18%) and “secondary research” (n = 44, 16%). While some studies still provide useful guidance today, most leishmaniasis research in Kenya needs to be updated and focused on prevention, co-infections, health systems/policy, and general topics, as these themes combined comprised less than 4% of published articles. Our findings also indicate minimal research on MCL (n = 1, &lt;1%) and PKDL (n = 2, 1%). We urge researchers to renew and expand their focus on these neglected diseases in Kenya.

Discussions have highlighted where sustainability should be integrated, and who is responsible for integrating sustainability – the instructor, institution, or both (Natkin, 2016; Ofei-Manu &amp; Didham, 2014; Percival, 1997; Ralph &amp; Stubbs, 2014; Reid, 1996; Wakefield, 2003; Wyatt, 2014). The overwhelming majority of these articles and discourses are written by academics and revolve around developing a process or evaluating data. Interestingly, very few incorporate the perspective of the student being taught, or even seek to capture what may influence a student to take sustainability action. Instead, much research assesses student behavior through questionnaires and surveys at a point in time and therefore misses the evaluation of behavioral change. This latter point is significant given that teaching and learning are not necessarily synonymous with doing. There is arguably a significant value–action gap when it comes to sustainability (Swaim et al., 2014). It is not that information is unknown but that even with information, action is not taken. The discussion included in this Student Perspective is written by students addressing one channel that has been effective in prompting our individual action—film. In the sections that follow, we highlight how the use of documentary film in an economics of sustainability course at Northeastern University connected the academic instruction related to food waste, fast fashion, and plastics to empathy, and how empathy has affected our behavior. The goal of the discussion is to raise awareness of the need to engage students' conscience and trigger the morality that relates to sustainability as a purpose rather than a topic of discussion.
