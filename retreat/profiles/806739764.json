Particularly interested in developing novel food production methods, especially precision fermentation, cellular agriculture, and plant-based. As part of my bachelor's thesis, I comparatively analysed the environmental impact of alternative proteins production for food industry. During my BSc in Biotechnology studies, I have taken advantage of the opportunities given to me by the university and have actively contributed to cultural, social and scientific life. I have held the position of Students President at the Faculty of Biotechnology, a member of the Student Government Council Board, a member of the Faculty Council, and a senator of the University of Wrocław. I represented the Faculty Scientific Club at conferences, and co-organised the first international conference BioLOCK 2024. I coordinated the project to create a common space for people studying at the Faculty. I was a member of the academic choir. Back in high school, I participated in the nationwide Fridays For Future movement. As part of my activities, I took part in creating the first climate resolution in the history of the Polish parliament. My FFF experiences helped me develop my teamwork skills. I strengthened them by working as a Group Leader at Aiglon College in the summer of 2022, as well as during a laboratory internship at the pharmaceutical company WZZ Herbapol S.A in the summer of 2023.
