My academic journey followed a successful internship at Embrapa Agroenergia, where my core competencies in technical project management and attention to detail were instrumental in optimizing renewable diesel production processes. Our team's collaborative efforts led to significant advancements in hydrogenation tests and process parameters. At CNPq, as a Scientific Researcher, I harnessed the power of Density Functional Theory and Python coding to drive computational studies in organic materials. This experience honed my professional skills, particularly in data analysis and numerical simulations. I'm eager to integrate this expertise with the values and mission of future organizations, contributing to a culture of innovation and excellence while offering a diverse perspective on complex scientific challenges.","picture_url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D03AQHobfX8CLYCmg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0/1713124007719?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=gexdzo3ws3GG3X1hN9Dbxw1dVfcOkAWjN43aNAEyU4Q","location_country":"Denmark","location_country_iso2":"DK","location_country_iso3":"DNK","location_full":"Denmark","location_regions":["Europe","Northern Europe","EMEA","EU"],"location_city":null,"location_state":null,"interests":[],"inferred_skills":["project management","data analysis","critical thinking","product quality","data collection","engineering","management","diesel","production","theory","python","analysis","simulations","innovation","physics","research","dft","software","cgmp","manufacturing","projects","reporting"],"historical_skills":[],"connections_count":253,"followers_count":258,"services":null,"primary_professional_email":null,"primary_professional_email_status":null,"professional_emails_collection":[],"is_working":1,"active_experience_company_id":11475110,"active_experience_title":"Student Assistant","active_experience_description":null,"active_experience_department":"Education","active_experience_management_level":"Intern","is_decision_maker":0,"total_experience_duration_months":77,"total_experience_duration_months_breakdown_department":[{"department":"Education","total_experience_duration_months":20},{"department":"Other","total_experience_duration_months":12},{"department":"Research","total_experience_duration_months":49}],"total_experience_duration_months_breakdown_management_level":[{"management_level":"Intern","total_experience_duration_months":23},{"management_level":"Specialist","total_experience_duration_months":54}],"experience":[{"active_experience":1,"position_title":"Student Assistant","department":"Education","management_level":"Intern","location":"Denmark","description":null,"date_from":"March 2025","date_from_year":2025,"date_from_month":3,"date_to":null,"date_to_year":null,"date_to_month":null,"duration_months":8,"company_id":11475110,"company_name":"Siemens Gamesa","company_type":"Public Company","company_founded_year":2017,"company_followers_count":948259,"company_website":"https://www.siemensgamesa.com","company_facebook_url":["https://www.facebook.com/siemensgamesa"],"company_twitter_url":["https://www.twitter.com/siemensgamesa"],"company_linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/siemensgamesa","company_size_range":"10,001+ employees","company_employees_count":17667,"company_industry":"Renewable Energy Semiconductor Manufacturing","company_categories_and_keywords":["renewable energy","wind turbine generators","offshore wind power","onshore wind power","energy storage solutions","hybrid energy solutions","wind turbine operation and maintenance","wind power service","wind energy","wind power","wind power digitalization","wind digital solutions","wind power diagnostics","heath storage","wind turbine engineering","offshore","sustainability","wind turbines","onshore","energy-utilities","energy-services","energy-storage","hydrogen","renewables","electrical distribution","energy"],"company_annual_revenue_source_5":9747465000,"company_annual_revenue_currency_source_5":"USD","company_annual_revenue_source_1":82248000.0,"company_annual_revenue_currency_source_1":"EUR","company_employees_count_change_yearly_percentage":-3.778989189688626,"company_last_funding_round_date":null,"company_last_funding_round_amount_raised":null,"company_hq_full_address":"Parque Tecnológico de Bizkaia, edificio 222;
