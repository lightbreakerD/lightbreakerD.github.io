With this dream accomplished I am now entering my final year of engineering studies at DTU, with a specialisation in sustainability and entrepreneurship. During my studies I have wanted to engage in the Nordic startup ecosystem, and working for the past two years at CPH fintech has allowed me to do that, across a number of roles. Upon finishing my studies next year at DTU and with my experience in the Copenhagen Fintech lab, I am excited for what the future might bring :-)","picture_url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E03AQECDGf3w9ltQw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0/1677164121645?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=AsysS1wrul9Kwir_NABrN61xpcVHhzY7XbNdpxHvlbQ","location_country":"Denmark","location_country_iso2":"DK","location_country_iso3":"DNK","location_full":"Copenhagen, Capital Region of Denmark, Denmark","location_regions":["Europe","Northern Europe","EMEA","EU"],"location_city":"Copenhagen","location_state":"Capital Region of Denmark","interests":[],"inferred_skills":["marketing communications","education","engineering","sustainability","entrepreneurship","fintech","salesforce","marketing","communications","intelligence"],"historical_skills":[],"connections_count":500,"followers_count":92,"services":null,"primary_professional_email":null,"primary_professional_email_status":null,"professional_emails_collection":[],"is_working":1,"active_experience_company_id":23927952,"active_experience_title":"Venture Analyst","active_experience_description":"KRING® is a family of impact funds.
