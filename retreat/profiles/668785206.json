I am also a project lead at Space Team Aachen, a student organization that works on various aerospace projects including rockets, satellites and rovers. As a project lead and system engineer, I am responsible for overseeing design, integration, and testing of all subsystems of the Hopper, a student-developed rocket hopper that aims to demonstrate propulsive landing from low altitudes. Before co-founding the Hopper Project, I had the opportunity to gain experience as a propulsion engineer, working on the development and testing of hybrid rocket engines for the STAHR project. I am passionate about advancing the field of reusable launch vehicles in Europe, and I am eager to learn from and contribute to the innovative and collaborative culture of the Space Team Aachen.","picture_url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E03AQHCYD2bg_uIUQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0/1683049917216?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=ZKFnO6grrAlYjsrdjZRuI9E07_wxvu78Y-gnuIPTuA4","location_country":"Germany","location_country_iso2":"DE","location_country_iso3":"DEU","location_full":"Aachen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany","location_regions":["Europe","Western Europe","EMEA","EU"],"location_city":"Aachen","location_state":"North Rhine-Westphalia","interests":[],"inferred_skills":["mechanical","engineering","aerospace","projects","responsible","design","integration","testing","propulsion","budget","components","manufacturing","mechanical engineering","aerospace engineering","integration testing","additive manufacturing"],"historical_skills":[],"connections_count":303,"followers_count":307,"services":null,"primary_professional_email":null,"primary_professional_email_status":null,"professional_emails_collection":[],"is_working":1,"active_experience_company_id":24295389,"active_experience_title":"Project Lead - Hopper Project","active_experience_description":"We founded the Hopper Project with the mission to build a student-developed rocket hopper, capable of performing propulsive landings from low altitudes.
