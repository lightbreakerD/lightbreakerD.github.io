From early days on I have participated in several programs, such as ERASMUS+, where we put together and taught Integrated Learning lessons for elementary school. The kids had to program robots to play music. Also experienced in VR, I have the knowledge necessary for building VR videos, or games. During Hüppelaud in 2019 I was part of the team, that built a Chemistry Sandbox game for VR-classroom experience. Furthermore, I have since then advanced to building and developing more high-level projects. That includes AI trash can, that can recycle trash by itself and an app, that uses NFC features to identify the user in libraries, public transportation, etc. - the last project being Konnekt EE, where I am also one of the Co-Founders.","picture_url":"https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/9c8pery4andzj6ohjkjp54ma2","location_country":"Estonia","location_country_iso2":"EE","location_country_iso3":"EST","location_full":"Tartu, Tartumaa, Estonia","location_regions":["Europe","Northern Europe","EMEA","EU"],"location_city":"Tartu","location_state":"Tartumaa","interests":[],"inferred_skills":["enthusiast","projects","nfc","libraries","transportation","due diligence"],"historical_skills":[],"connections_count":179,"followers_count":23,"services":null,"primary_professional_email":null,"primary_professional_email_status":null,"professional_emails_collection":[],"is_working":1,"active_experience_company_id":26897750,"active_experience_title":"Student","active_experience_description":null,"active_experience_department":"Education","active_experience_management_level":"Specialist","is_decision_maker":0,"total_experience_duration_months":66,"total_experience_duration_months_breakdown_department":[{"department":"C-Suite","total_experience_duration_months":69},{"department":"Other","total_experience_duration_months":2},{"department":"Education","total_experience_duration_months":48}],"total_experience_duration_months_breakdown_management_level":[{"management_level":"Specialist","total_experience_duration_months":48},{"management_level":"Other","total_experience_duration_months":2},{"management_level":"Founder","total_experience_duration_months":69}],"experience":[{"active_experience":1,"position_title":"Student","department":"Education","management_level":"Specialist","location":null,"description":null,"date_from":"September 2022","date_from_year":2022,"date_from_month":9,"date_to":null,"date_to_year":null,"date_to_month":null,"duration_months":38,"company_id":26897750,"company_name":"University of Tartu","company_type":"Educational","company_founded_year":1632,"company_followers_count":55478,"company_website":"https://www.ut.ee","company_facebook_url":["https://www.facebook.com/tartuylikool","https://www.facebook.com/tartuuniversity"],"company_twitter_url":["https://www.twitter.com/tartuuniversity","https://www.twitter.com/unitartu"],"company_linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/university-of-tartu","company_size_range":"1001-5000 employees","company_employees_count":1958,"company_industry":"Higher Education","company_categories_and_keywords":["education","medicine","arts and humanities","social sciences","science and technology","law","economics","computer science","baltic countries","world-class","university"],"company_annual_revenue_source_5":null,"company_annual_revenue_currency_source_5":null,"company_annual_revenue_source_1":null,"company_annual_revenue_currency_source_1":null,"company_employees_count_change_yearly_percentage":4.327076041998091,"company_last_funding_round_date":"2025-06-25","company_last_funding_round_amount_raised":116246494,"company_hq_full_address":"Ülikooli 18;
